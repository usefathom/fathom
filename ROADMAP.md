Ana Roadmap
===========

This is a general draft document for thoughts and todo's, without any structure to it.

### What's cooking?

- Update page title when it changes.
- Custom date range picker
- Bulk process tracking requests (Redis or in-memory?)
- Allow sorting in table overviews.
- Choose a OS license & settle on name.
- Envelope API responses & perhaps return total in table overview?
- Geolocate IP addresses periodically.
- Mask last part of IP address.
